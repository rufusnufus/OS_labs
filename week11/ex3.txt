The difference is in printing "Hello\nHello\n" or "Hello\n\n". 
Probably buffer devastates when meets '\n' symbol, that's why in the 1st program 
fork() copied not empty buffer("Hello") after that both processes have each buffer 
with "Hello" and after that each executes printf("\n"), while in the 2nd program 
fork() makes buffer empty after printf("Hello\n"), so both processes have empty 
buffers before printf("\n").
