Q: What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

A physical address:
					- provided by hardware, computed by MMU
					- exists physically(in main memory)
					- cannot be accessed directly by users, only indirectly(virtual address, MMU)

A virtual address:
					- provided by OS, generated by CPU
					- does not exist physically in the memory unit
					- good decision of isolating processes, each virtual address 
					to each process
					- can be accessed directly by users, also can be used to 
					access the physical address(MMU)
					- mapped to the physical address, because physical memory 
					usually might be less than virtual 
					(virtual memory = physical memory + swapping memory)
